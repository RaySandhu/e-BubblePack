e-BubblePack Medication Tracker Application
This application is designed to help you track your daily medication intake. It allows you to view your daily medication schedules and record whether you have taken or missed any medication doses.

**_Installation_**
Ensure that you have Java installed on your computer. You can check if you have Java installed by running the command java -version in your terminal or command prompt. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Download the e-BubblePack.jar file.

To run the application, navigate to the directory where you saved the e-BubblePack.jar file in your terminal or command prompt.

For the final application, Run the command ` java -jar e-BubblePack.jar` to start the application. But as we are still working on this code and is not yet fully implemented (i.e. is only command line based) you can run in through your code editor.

**_Usage_**
When you first start the application, you will be presented with the main menu. The current time and date will be displayed, along with a list of options to select from. Once you have selected a day to view, you will be presented with a list of medications that are due to be taken on that day. To select a medication, type the corresponding number and press Enter.

You will be able to click anywhere on the button to toggle the taken or not-taken status of each dose of each med and in the drop down menu on the right, you can also delete specific doses of each medication.

Here you can add the medication information as appropriate and add as many doses per day by choosing the time in 24hr clock (hrs and min fields separated)
and clicking "Add time". You can also delete unwanted dose times by clicking the dose time button that was generated.
At this point, check if your information is valid by "Check(ing) for Submission", hit Submit and you're all done!
